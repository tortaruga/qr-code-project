### What I learned

The biggest difficulty for this project was using GitHub (I'm still not 100% sure I did everything correctly...), and the biggest joy was discovering that it's not as hopeless as it seems. I tried to make sense of it a few times before but it felt overwhelming and I always just gave up, so thank you for leading me!
